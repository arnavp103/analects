> Analects - selected miscellaneous written passages (Mariam Webster)

These are my analects, a collection of thoughts, ideas, and experiences. My goal is to update the site regularly and try to keep a diverse range of content. Many of these writings will be written with myself as the primary audience, while others will be more explorative and educational.


## Built With

This site was envisioned to be simple to maintain and write to, yet expressive enough to include interactive elements and rich media.
To that end I built this with astro, tailwind, and a bit of svelte for interactivity.
