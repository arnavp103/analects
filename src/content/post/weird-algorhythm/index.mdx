import Pronounciations from "./Pronounciations.svelte"



This is a fun little tool inspired by something I saw from a Strange Loop Talk[^1]. The idea is to parody songs by taking in the lyrics, finding replacements for each line that sound phonetically similar, and then outputting the new lyrics. I couldn't find a link to the project, so I just decided to build my own for fun.
