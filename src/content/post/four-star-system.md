When it comes to understanding and conveying the effect a piece of art had on you, I find that there's no better tool than language. If you want to recommend a book to me, a dozen sentences are going to be far more useful than any percentage rating. With all that said though, sometimes you'd rather not interrupt the conversation (especially if it's on text) with a long-winded review, or you just cannot put to terms why you like something. In these cases, I like to guage the reception with a simple heuristic: "Give it a rating out of four."

Whenever I'm discussing or sharing recommendations for movies or shows, I've recently started rating them out of four. I find this scale to be paradoxically more intuitive and signal-dense than asking people to give a rating out of ten, or a percentage.
